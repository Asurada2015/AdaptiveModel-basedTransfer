# Adaptive Model-based Transfer for Binary problems

This repository contains the Matlab implementation of our work [Curbing Negative Influences Online for Seamless Transfer Evolutionary Optimization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326846571_Curbing_Negative_Influences_Online_for_Seamless_Transfer_Evolutionary_Optimization).

## Usage
The `demo.m` file implements a toy example in the paper, in which the source tasks are `one-max` and `one-min`, and the target task is `trap-5`. 

In `MOO\`, we have included examples for AMT-enabled NSGA-II.
